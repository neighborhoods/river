### Added
- General usage documentation
- Progress bar functionality for reading, writing, and copying operations
- Support for Avro filetype
- Regular expression matching functionality for `list_objects`
- `list_objects` can now return greater than 1000 objects - previously,
the list was truncated at 1000
- Bugfix: Kwargs can now be passed when writing in Parquet format. All other
formats accepted kwargs, but it was left out from Parquet as an oversight.
- Bugfix: Relaxed requirements on what was considered a valid S3 key for the
`recursive` option of `list_objects`. Prior to this, `list_objects` was filtering
out keys that it was not supposed to under certain circumstances.
S3 will not allow invalid keys in the first place, no reason we need to account for it
- Bugfix: Default values for `bucket` (as provided by environment variables)
is now evaluated at function call-time rather than upon import

### Changed
- Switched to standard NHDS CI pipeline

- Hotfix: Error string formatting in `get_storage_fn`

## [0.1.0] - 2020-05-15

### Added
- Ability to read files from S3
- Ability to write files to S3
- Ability to list files in S3, with specific prefixes and output settings
- Ability to copy objects between two S3 locations
- Storage formats: CSV, Pickle, Parquet

### Changed
- Default CSV writing behavior as was present prior to this code being made into its own package.
